### Incorporating Memoization for Efficiency

1. **Memoize Personalized Satisfaction Scores**:
   - Store the **personalized satisfaction score** for each product-recipient pair in a dictionary (or a similar data structure).
   - Use a unique key format like `f"{product_id}_{recipient_id}"` to store the computed satisfaction score.
   - Before recalculating, check if the score already exists in the dictionary.

   ```python
   satisfaction_memo = {}

   def get_personalized_satisfaction(product, recipient):
       key = f"{product.name}_{recipient.id}"
       if key not in satisfaction_memo:
           relevance_points = calculate_relevance_points(recipient.tags, product.tags)
           satisfaction_memo[key] = calculate_personalized_satisfaction(product, relevance_points)
       return satisfaction_memo[key]
   ```

2. **Memoize Synergy Points Between Product Pairs**:
   - Since synergy points between product pairs donâ€™t change for different recipients, you can store the synergy calculation results in a dictionary using the product pair as the key.
   - Use a sorted tuple `(product_a.name, product_b.name)` as the key to store synergy points between each unique product pair.

   ```python
   synergy_memo = {}

   def get_synergy_points(product_a, product_b):
       key = tuple(sorted([product_a.name, product_b.name]))
       if key not in synergy_memo:
           if product_b.name in product_a.synergy_items or product_a.name in product_b.synergy_items:
               synergy_memo[key] = 15  # Assume 15 points for a synergy pair
           else:
               synergy_memo[key] = 0
       return synergy_memo[key]
   ```

3. **Reuse Cached Results During Genetic and Simulated Annealing Iterations**:
   - Since Genetic and Simulated Annealing algorithms often evaluate many similar bundles, using memoized satisfaction and synergy scores reduces redundant calculations.
   - When evaluating new bundles, you can pull satisfaction and synergy scores from the cache, significantly reducing computation time.
