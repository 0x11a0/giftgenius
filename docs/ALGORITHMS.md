### Hybrid Algorithm for Gift Selection

1. **Step 1: Greedy Algorithm for Initial Bundle Selection**  
   - **Objective**: Use the Greedy Algorithm to generate an initial gift bundle that maximizes value per dollar within the budget.
   - **Process**: Calculate the **personalized satisfaction per dollar** for each product and add products to the bundle in descending order of value per dollar until the budget is reached.
   - **Output**: This provides a quick, decent-quality solution and acts as the starting point for further optimization.

2. **Step 2: Genetic Algorithm for Refinement**
   - **Objective**: Use the Genetic Algorithm to optimize the initial bundle by exploring alternative bundles through evolution.
   - **Process**:
     - **Initialize** the population with the initial bundle from the Greedy Algorithm.
     - **Fitness Function**: Measure each bundle’s fitness based on total satisfaction score (personalized satisfaction + synergy).
     - **Selection, Crossover, and Mutation**: Generate new bundle variations to discover potentially higher satisfaction scores.
   - **Output**: The Genetic Algorithm refines the bundle, aiming to maximize satisfaction by iteratively testing new bundle configurations.

3. **Step 3: Simulated Annealing for Final Optimization**
   - **Objective**: Use Simulated Annealing to fine-tune the optimized bundle from the Genetic Algorithm by exploring small changes while avoiding local optima.
   - **Process**:
     - **Temperature Parameter**: Set a decreasing “temperature” that controls the likelihood of accepting suboptimal solutions early on, helping escape local optima.
     - **Neighbor Selection**: Make small changes to the bundle (e.g., swapping one product) and evaluate the satisfaction score.
     - **Acceptance Criteria**: Accept solutions with higher scores or, with decreasing probability, lower scores to explore the solution space effectively.
   - **Output**: The result is a highly optimized bundle, combining the benefits of Greedy for a quick start, Genetics for evolution, and Simulated Annealing for final refinement.

This hybrid approach efficiently combines the **speed** of Greedy, the **evolutionary potential** of Genetic Algorithms, and the **local optimization** abilities of Simulated Annealing.
